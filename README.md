## Practice Questions 
 
### Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order. Example: [1, 2, 3, 4] => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 

### You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed 'age' of 0. Return a new array with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age]. 
 
### Sum all the numbers of the array except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!). Example: [ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 ] => 16 [ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 ] => 6
